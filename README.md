# Abstract: Decentralized Healthcare Record System

Introduction
------------

The Decentralized Healthcare Record System (DHRS) is a blockchain-based solution that ensures secure, immutable, and accessible medical records. By leveraging Ethereum smart contracts, IPFS/Filecoin for decentralized storage, and token-based access control, this system enhances patient privacy while enabling seamless healthcare management.

Problem Statement
-----------------

Traditional healthcare record systems suffer from issues such as data breaches, lack of interoperability, and unauthorized access. Centralized databases are vulnerable to cyberattacks and unauthorized modifications, making it difficult for patients to control their own medical data securely.

Proposed Solution
-----------------

This project aims to develop a Decentralized Healthcare Record System that offers:

Blockchain-based security: All medical records are stored on IPFS/Filecoin, ensuring immutability.

Smart Contract Authentication: Patients control who can access their records.

Token-Based Access Control: Doctors receive access only if the patient grants permission.

Event-Driven Notifications: Doctors get notified when a patient updates their medical data.

System Architecture

Frontend: Built with Next.js for a seamless user experience.

Blockchain Backend: Ethereum smart contracts deployed on a testnet (Goerli/Sepolia).

Storage: IPFS/Filecoin for decentralized medical record storage.

Authentication: MetaMask/Web3.js for secure login.

Backend API: Express.js + MongoDB for managing non-blockchain data.

Key Features
------------

Patient-Doctor Verification: Secure authentication with blockchain-based records.

Decentralized Storage: Medical records stored securely with IPFS/Filecoin.

Tokenized Access Control: Patients grant/revoke access using ERC-20/ERC-721 tokens.

Smart Contract Event Handling: Logs every record update, access, and permission grant.

Email Notifications: Doctors are alerted when new records are available.

Secure Record Retrieval: Doctors can fetch patient records only with valid access.

Conclusion
----------

This system revolutionizes healthcare data management by ensuring security, transparency, and patient control over medical records. It eliminates the risks of centralized storage and unauthorized access while improving the efficiency of healthcare services.
